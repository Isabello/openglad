This program is for use with Gladiator, if you've never heard of it go
to http://www.fsgames.com and download it, or Email any of these people:

Boost is simple to use, from your command line just type "boost <savefile>"
without the quotes.  <savefile> can be save1.gtl, save2.gtl...save5.gtl.
If you feel you really must use Windows the same can be done.

Boost will then set every statistic of each character in your team to 5000,  
each character's level to 500 and give the team a lot of money.  This leaves 
you with some room to expand the character if you should feel the need to do 
so. Be carefull however, because hit points exceeding the 32767 will wrap 
around to a negative number, causing you to die in one hit.

Another caveat: Boost doesn't check to see if the file you specified is 
the right version or not, or even if it's a Gladiator save file.  So in theory 
you could go around trying to Boost all your system files... 
this is a bad idea.  
In other words, don't use this program on anything unless you're sure it's 
not going to destroy it. 

Please feel free to Email me with any thoughts/ideas/bugs Etc.  But bear in 
mind that this isn't what I'd call a major project I'll be working on. :)
