--------------------------------------------------

1) Install SDL, SDL_image and SDL_mixer from ports:

	cd /usr/ports/devel/sdl12
	make all install clean

	cd /usr/ports/graphics/sdl_image
	make all install clean

	cd /usr/ports/audio/sdl_mixer
	make all install clean

Link sdl11-config to sdl-config so the configure script will pick it up:
	ln -s /usr/local/bin/sdl11-config /usr/local/bin/sdl-config
Or you can just set an environment variable pointing to it when ./configure fails...

2) *If compiling the CVS version*, you'll need to install the GNU Auto utils:

	cd /usr/ports/devel/autoconf
	make all install clean

	cd /usr/ports/devel/automake
	make all install clean

3) Install GNU Make:

	cd /usr/ports/devel/gmake
	make all install clean

4) Build openglad:
	
	// cd to the openglad source directory
	// If you're compiling from CVS, prepare the source tree like so:

	aclocal
	autoconf
	automake

	// Regardless, you need to run configure:
	./configure
	// Make using Gnu Make:
	gmake
	
	// Install:
	gmake install

5) Install the data: 
	
	mkdir ~/.openglad
	mkdir ~/.openglad/save
	cp -R pix ~/.openglad/
	cp -R sound ~/.openglad/
	cp -R scen ~/.openglad/
	cp -R *.001 ~/.openglad/
	cp openglad.cfg ~/.openglad/

6) Edit config file:

	// You'll probably want to use EAGLE or SAI rendering
	vi ~/.openglad/openglad.cfg


8) Play:

	/usr/local/games/openglad

=======
Windows
=======
A Visual C++ Makefile can be found in src/. You might need to
edit the paths to the SDL lib/includes. To from the command line, execute
vcvars32.bat (should be in VC98/) and then execute nmake /f Makefile.vc 
(or nmake /f Makefile.vc openscen) in the openglad src/ dir(Thanks Murlock)

=======

openglad is the game binary, openscen is the editor.


If you get Openglad to work on any other operating systems,
please tell us how you did. You can contact one of the
Snowstorm Entertainment guys or post on the forums.
