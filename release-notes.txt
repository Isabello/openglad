This release, OpenGlad 0.1, is a completely unaltered version of the Gladiator 3.8 source that
was given to Snowstorm by FSGames. The directory contains compiled binaries and all that messy
stuff, but as we are not sure that the source will compile under any modern compiler, we've
left them in.

Again, this release is 100% Forgotten Sages' code. All credit goes to them. Thank you, FSGames.
